This file describes  what additions/changes will be made after the patch is applied

1.Two files: rri-module.cc and rri-module.h are created in the folder:
	.../ns-allinone-3.27/ns-3.27/src/wifi/model/   directory
	
	The RriModule class makes the appropriate radio measurement details for any device like SNR, load on AP and stores the details in separate datastructures.
	
2. Example simulation script twoRadioSnrAssn will be created in the folder 
	.../ns-allinone-3.27/ns-3.27/scratch

	This script has the  network scenario for deploying the wifinodes and the logic to associate with the best AP based on the snr.

3. Run the script as follows:
	./waf --run scratch/twoRadioSnrAssn
